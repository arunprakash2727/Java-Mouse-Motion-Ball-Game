# Ball Game - Java AWT

## Description
This Java package, `BallGame`, contains a simple interactive game utilizing the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). The game creates a ball that follows the mouse cursor within a window. As the cursor moves, the ball's position adjusts accordingly, creating an interactive motion experience.

## Usage
The `BallGame` package consists of the following files:
- `BallGame.java`: Implements the game functionality, including the ball and mouse movement handling.
- `BallGameDemo.java`: Contains the main method to initialize and run the `BallGame`.

To run the game:
1. Compile the Java files in the package.
2. Execute the `BallGameDemo.java` file to launch the game window.
3. Move the mouse cursor within the game window to interact with the ball.

## Notes
- The game utilizes AWT to create a basic graphical interface.
- The ball's movement is controlled by the mouse cursor's position.
- This is a simple demonstration showcasing mouse motion handling in Java AWT.
